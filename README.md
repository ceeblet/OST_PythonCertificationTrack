* Create/Develop generators and decorators.
* Utilize introspection, multi-threading, and multi-processing techniques.

Upon completion, not only will you have earned a Certificate of Professional Development, but you will also have built large-scale web interfaces and database applications in Python that can be displayed as part of your professional portfolio.
